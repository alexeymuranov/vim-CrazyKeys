Vim plugin with crazy custom key mappings, with possibility
to support multiple layouts (besides the common Qwerty) and
multiple configurations (like left-handed and right-handed).

**Work in progress.**

Here are some highlights.

* To enter *Insert* mode from *Normal* mode, just press `<Space>`.

* To scroll a window of a read-only buffer one window down in *Normal* mode,
  just press `<Space>`.

* To *yank* current selection in *Visual* mode, just press `<Space>`.

* To exit *Insert* mode back to *Normal* mode, just press `<Space>`...
  no, this was a joke, press `<Esc>`, or `<Control-L>`, or
  `<Control-Space>`, or `<Shift-Space>`.

* To enter *Command* mode from *Normal* mode, press `<Enter>` or
  `<Control-X>`.
